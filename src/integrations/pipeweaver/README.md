# PipeWeaver Integration

---

This code primarily integrates with the PipeWeaver API to allow for the Mix and Mix Create to control audio
on the system, as well as present a UI display on those devices.

This code will be as isolated as possible, and built in such a way where (hopefully) other providers can be
built by others to provide the same functionality.
